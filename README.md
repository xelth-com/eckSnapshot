# eckSnapshot

A lightweight, platform-independent CLI for creating focused, AI-ready project snapshots.

`eckSnapshot` is a powerful command-line tool designed to solve a critical problem in AI-assisted development: providing clear, complete, and focused context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows you to package an entire project codebase—or just specific parts of it—into a single, clean text file.

This tool is built for a modern workflow where you act as the architect, guiding the overall strategy, while AI agents handle the detailed implementation.

## The Core Workflow

`eckSnapshot` is designed to support a two-part AI workflow for maximum efficiency and quality:

1.  **The Architect LLM (Gemini, GPT-4, Grok):** A model with a large context window. You provide it with a snapshot of your project, and it analyzes the codebase to create a high-level plan for new features or refactoring.
2.  **The Coder LLM (Claude Code, Minimax, etc.):** A model specialized in writing and modifying code. It takes the detailed instructions generated by the Architect and performs the hands-on coding tasks.

## Requirements

1.  **Node.js** (v18.x or higher).
2.  **An AI Assistant CLI (at least one):**
    *   **Claude:** An active **Claude Pro** subscription and the `claude-code` CLI installed.
    *   **OpenAI:** An active **ChatGPT Plus/Pro** subscription and the `@openai/codex` CLI installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex`).

## Installation

Install `eckSnapshot` globally on your system using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @xelth/eck-snapshot
```

Once installed, you can run the tool using the `eck-snapshot` command from any directory.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Using eckSnapshot

Here’s the most common workflow, from creating a full snapshot to focusing on specific features.

#### Step 1: Create a Full Project Snapshot

This is your primary command. It scans your project and packs all relevant code into a single file.

> **Usage:**
> ```bash
> dimi@xelth:/mnt/c/Users/xelth/myProject$ eck-snapshot
> ```

*   **What it does:** Creates a file like `myProject_snapshot_... .md` in the `.eck/snapshots/` directory. This file contains your project's directory structure and the complete code. You can now pass this file to your Architect LLM for analysis.

#### Step 2: Handle Large Projects with Auto-Profiling

If your project is too large for an LLM's context window, `profile-detect` can automatically slice it into logical parts (profiles) using AI.

> **Usage:**
> ```bash
> dimi@xelth:/mnt/c/Users/xelth/myProject$ eck-snapshot profile-detect
> ```

*   **Output Example:**
    ```
    ✨ Detected Profiles:
    ---------------------------
      - cli
      - services
      - core
      - templates
      - docs
      - config
    ```
*   **What it does:** Analyzes your project and saves these logical groupings into a `.eck/profiles.json` file, which you can use in the next step.

#### Step 3: Use Profiles to Create Focused Snapshots

The `--profile` option gives you powerful control over what goes into a snapshot. You can combine profiles, exclude files, and even use ad-hoc patterns.

> **Example 1: Combine and Exclude Profiles**
>
> Create a snapshot of the core logic, services, and CLI, but exclude all documentation and configuration files.
> ```bash
> eck-snapshot --profile "core,services,cli,-docs,-config"
> ```

> **Example 2: Use Ad-Hoc Glob Patterns**
>
> Include all `.js` files in the `src` directory but exclude all test files, without using a pre-defined profile.
> ```bash
> eck-snapshot --profile "src/**/*.js,-**/*.test.js"
> ```
> *Note: Quotes are required when using complex patterns with wildcards (`*`) or commas.*

#### Step 4: Intelligently Prune a Snapshot

If a snapshot is still too large, `prune` uses AI to shrink it to a target size, keeping only the most important files for understanding the code.

> **Usage:**
> ```bash
> eck-snapshot prune myProject_snapshot.md --target-size 500KB
> ```

#### Step 5 (Alternative): Truncate Files by Line Count

A faster, non-AI method to reduce snapshot size. This command keeps only the top N lines of each file, which is useful for a high-level architectural overview.

> **Usage:**
> ```bash
> eck-snapshot --max-lines-per-file 200
> ```

## Auxiliary Commands

*   `restore <snapshot_file>`: Recreates a project's file structure from a snapshot.
*   `generate-profile-guide`: Creates a guide for manual profile creation. Use this if `profile-detect` fails on very large projects, as it allows you to use an LLM with a larger context window (e.g., a web UI).
*   `detect`: Shows how `eckSnapshot` has identified your project type and what default file filters are being applied.
*   `ask-gpt` / `ask-claude`: Directly delegate a task to your configured AI coder agents from the command line.
*   `setup-gemini`: A utility to automatically configure integration with the `gemini-cli`.
