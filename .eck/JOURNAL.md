## Switch ask-gpt from chatgpt-cli to official codex CLI

- Replaced `npx chatgpt` calls with the official `codex` CLI, using the `exec --full-auto` command for machine-readable output.
- Implemented an automatic login flow that detects authentication errors and triggers the interactive `codex login` command.
- Created a new `authService.js` to handle the login initiation.
- Removed the `open` package dependency as it is no longer needed.
- Updated tests in `gptService.test.js` to mock the new `codex` command flow.
- Added comprehensive documentation in README.md for both ChatGPT and Claude Code integration.
- Enhanced CLI help with detailed examples and authentication instructions.

## Enable and document claude-code auto-accept mode

Created a global `settings.json` for claude-code to enable `acceptEdits` by default, allowing for fully autonomous operation. Added a `CLAUDE_SETUP.md` file to document this essential configuration step for new developers or fresh installations.

## Create custom /eck:commit claude-code command

Added a custom slash command to automate the new structured journaling and conventional commit process. This command takes structured input (type, scope, summary, details) and uses it to update JOURNAL.md and create a git commit, enforcing our new workflow.
