## Enable and document claude-code auto-accept mode

Created a global `settings.json` for claude-code to enable `acceptEdits` by default, allowing for fully autonomous operation. Added a `CLAUDE_SETUP.md` file to document this essential configuration step for new developers or fresh installations.

## Create custom /eck:commit claude-code command

Added a custom slash command to automate the new structured journaling and conventional commit process. This command takes structured input (type, scope, summary, details) and uses it to update JOURNAL.md and create a git commit, enforcing our new workflow.
